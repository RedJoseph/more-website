<h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;"> &nbsp &nbsp Description of the seminar </h2>


<p>
    This is a learning seminar in preparation for the <a href="https://swc-math.github.io/"> Arizona Winter School 2024</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The aim is to spend the six weeks preceding the AWS to review the lecture notes and problem sets from the 
    <a href="https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2024/2024PAWS.html"> Preliminary Arizona Winter School 2023 </a>
    which was on Abelian varieties over finite fields and Elliptic curves with complex multiplication.
</p>

 
<h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;"> 
    &nbsp &nbsp Logistics Info 
</h2>
 
<p> 
    The seminar will be held on Wednesday from 6pm to 7:30pm in Room 622 in the Math Department at Columbia.
</p>
