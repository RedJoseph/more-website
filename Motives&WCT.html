<h1 style="font-size:35px;color:black;"> &nbsp Seminar on <em> Motives, Standard Conjectures and Weil Cohomology Theories</em>, Spring 2022 </h1>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;"> &nbsp &nbsp Description of the seminar </h2>


<p> The primary goal of the seminar would be to get acquainted with the language of motives and the questions surrounding them. </p>


<p> The first few talks aim at defining the category of correspondences and the 
symmetrical monoidal category of Chow Motives M(k), where k is an algebraically closed field. After that we will discuss classical 
Weil cohomology theories H*, tying them in with motives due to the property of factoring through the category M(k) and
their realization functors. (We will follow the chapter of stacks project [0FFG]).

<br>
<br>
Later we will study the interaction between standard conjectures and motives: in particular we will focus on semisimplicity (and how it doesn't need standard conjectures
in order to be proved [J]), on the existence of graded decomposition on the motive h(X), on the property of being Tannakian and the Motivic Galois Group. 
(We will use Milne's paper [M1] in order to navigate the topics, and as references Andr&eacute's book [A] and papers [J] & [S]).

<br>
<br>
Depending on the audience's preferences (as well as how much time we have left), we can either dig in some concrete computations from Scholl's paper [S] (graded decomposition 
for motives h(A) of abelian varieties, and computation of motives h1(X) and h2d−1(X), with X variety of dimension d [S]) or discuss Motives over finite fields (following [M2]).

<ol class="customIndent">
  <li> Feb 21 
    <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Motivations to Motives and Seminar Roadmap
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: I will talk about why we could be interested in the category of motives, 
  giving some motivations and the roadmap of the seminar. 
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We will also review the bare minimum needed to talk about intersection theory 
  and adequate equivalence relations.
  </li>
  
  <li> Feb 28 <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Category of correspondences and the one of rational motives
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: The program for today is to see the construction of the category of correspondences and the one of rational 
  motives M_rat(k). <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then we will discuss some of the properties of M_rat(k), in particular its symmetric monoidal structure and additive structure. 
  The existence of (left) duals is postponed to next week. </li>
  <li> Mar 07<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Classical Weil cohomology theories and their factorization through the category of Chow motives
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: We will resume the proof that Mrat(k) is Karoubian and has left duals. Then we will focus on Classical Weil cohomology theories, in particular on their factorization 
  through <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the category of rational motives Mrat(k). In order to do so, some formal properties of Weil cohomology theories will be recalled (but without proof). </li>
  <li> Mar 21<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Caleb Ji
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: The Standard Conjectures on Algebraic Cycles
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: In his work on motives and the Weil conjectures, Grothendieck formulated a set of conjectures on algebraic cycles which he called the standard conjectures. 
   <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We explain what they are and the known implications between them. Then we will explain their application to the Weil conjectures, and in particular to the proof of the Riemann hypothesis over function fields. 
   <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Caleb Ji's Notes: <a href="Standard_conjectures.pdf"> Standard Conjectures</a></li>
  <li> Mar 28 <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Manin's identity principle and abelianity and semisimplicity of M_~(k)
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: Today we will compute the motives of some concrete examples using Manin's identity principle, and looking at the relation between the motive
  of a curve and its Jacobian. Then we will see why 
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  the category of motives fails to be abelian and why the category of motives M_~(k) is semisimple iff ~ is the numerical equivalence. At the end, we will discuss which direction to focus on
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  in the upcoming meetings (if you have preferences, feel free to share them!). </li>
  <li> Apr 04 <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Avi Zeff
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: The Tannakian formalism and the motivic Galois group
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: We'll discuss rigid symmetric monoidal categories, their properties, and some examples, and then see how this structure gives rise to the 
   Tannakian formalism. We'll then try to apply <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp this formalism to the category of motives, using the standard conjectures, and try to describe the motivic Galos group.
</li>
  <li> Apr 11<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: The Tannakian formalism and the motivic Galois group (continuation)
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: We'll resume discussing Tannakian categories from where we left: in particular we'll see the general notion of Tannakian category via fibre functors, 
   how to associate an affine gerbe to any Tannakian <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp category C, and then how to realize C as a category of representations. After that we will focus on particular fibre functors, 
   namely the realization functors associated with  specific weil cohomology theories. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We'll see an overview of what is known/folklore about the motivic galois groups for Hodge structures of weight k 
and for l-adic cohomology theory. </li>
  <li> Apr 18 <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Numerical Motives over finite fields
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: Following Milne's Motives over Finite Fields, we will focus on the category of numerical motives over finite fields F_q assuming the truth of Tate's conjecture. In particular we will study 
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the fiber functors w_l for l-adic cohomology theories, with the aim of describing the motivic galois group GMot_{num}(F_q).</li>
  <li> Apr 25 <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Speaker: Morena Porzio
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Title: Motivic Galois Group of M_num(F_q) w.r.t. l-adic cohomology and over the algebraic closure of Q
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abstract: We will finish the discussion about the essential image of the realization functor w_l : M_num(F_q) \otimes Q_l ---> V_l(F_q) to then pass to the Motivic Galois 
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp group of it, giving a description of it as a proreductive affine group scheme. Then we will see that for any fiber functor w defined over the algebraic closure of Q the automorphisms group
  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aut^{\otimes}(w) is a group scheme P(q) whose characters coincide with the Weil q-numbers.
